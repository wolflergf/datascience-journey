# My Journey Towards Data Science Specialisation

This repository is the central log of my 11-month journey to become a specialist in **Python for Data Science and Machine Learning**. Prompted by the decision to transform my career and secure a stable future for my family, this space will serve as my portfolio, logbook, and proof of my commitment and progress.

The goal is to diligently follow the [Strategic Action Plan](https://github.com/wolflergf/datascience-journey/blob/main/career_action_plan.md), dedicating 3 hours daily to study and practice.

> "Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment." - Jim Rohn

## Repository Structure

- **/career-plan**: Contains the detailed strategic plan and all research documents.
- **/phase-01-foundations**: Projects and studies from months 1-3, focusing on Python, SQL, Statistics, and Visualisation.
- **/phase-02-machine-learning**: Projects and studies from months 4-6, focusing on Machine Learning algorithms and portfolio building.
- **/phase-03-deep-learning**: Projects and studies from months 7-8, focusing on Deep Learning, Neural Networks, and Cloud technologies.
- **/phase-04-job-preparation**: Capstone projects and interview preparation from months 9-11.

## Phase 1: Solid Foundations (Months 1-3)

The starting point of the journey. The focus here is to build an unshakeable foundation in programming, data manipulation, and statistics.

### Module 1: 100 Days of Code - Python Pro Bootcamp

The first practical challenge to solidify and deepen my Python knowledge. Progress will be documented daily in the `phase-01-foundations/100-days-of-code` folder.
