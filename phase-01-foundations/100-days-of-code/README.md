## Daily Breakdown

### Day 001: 8th November 2025

- **Topics:**

  - Course concept and environment setup (Python, PyCharm).
  - The `print()` function.
  - Comments and the importance of clean code.
  - String manipulation and the `len()` function.
  - Variables and naming conventions.
  - The `input()` function to capture user data.

- **Project of the Day:** Band Name Generator

  - **Description:** A simple programme that asks the user for the city they grew up in and the name of their pet, then combines the answers to suggest a band name.
  - **Code:** [Link to Day 001 Code](./day-001/)

- **Reflections:**
  - A solid review of fundamental concepts. The practice of creating a mini-project from day one is excellent for reinforcing the material. My focus is on keeping the code clean and well-commented from the outset. The goal of 3 hours per day has been successfully initiated.

### Day 002: 9th November 2025

- **Topics:**

  - Understanding Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings.
  - Python Primitive Data Types.
  - Type Error, Type Checking and Type Conversion.
  - Number Manipulation and F String.
  - Mathematical Operations.

- **Project of the Day:** Tip Calculator

  - **Description:** A simple programme that asks the user for the total bill, how much tip would you like to give and how many people to split the bill, then will show how much each person should pay.
  - **Code:** [Link to Day 002 Code](./day-002/)

- **Reflections:**
  - A solid review of fundamental concepts. The practice of creating a mini-project from day two is excellent for reinforcing the material. My focus is on keeping the code clean and well-commented from the outset. The goal of 3 hours per day has been successfully initiated.
